1.Git Clone:
Git clone is primarily used to point to an existing repo and make a clone or copy of that repo at in a new 
directory, at another location. The original repository can be located on the local filesystem or on remote 
machine accessible supported protocols. The git clone command copies an existing Git repository.
2.Git Push:
Git gives you a lot of ways to refer to a commit but for most purpose you will just use the name of branch 
with git push. Git push will push changes from all local branches to matchmaking branches. Git push mater 
will push changes from the local master branch to the remote master branch.

3.Git Pull:
The Git pull command is used to fetch and download content from a remote repository and immediately update 
the local repository to match that content. Merging remote upstream changes into your local repository is a 
common task in Git based collaboration work flows.

4.Git Branches:
A branch in Git is simply a lightweight moveable pointer to one of the commits. The default branch name in 
Git is master. As you start making commits, you are given a master branch that points to the last commit you made.
 Every time you commit, the master branch pointer moves forward automatically.

5.Git Commit:
The commit command is used to save your changes to the local repository. Using ‘Git commit’ command only saves
 a new commit object in the local Git repository. Exchanging commits has to be performed manually and explicitly.
